3D model of a Coast Guard vessel
================================

A low-polygon model of a Coast Guard multi-purpose vessel (light ice-breaking, buoy laying, and search-and-rescue), designed for the open-source FlightGear flight simulator.  The model has a deck for helicopter landing, but no hangar.  It is inspired by the CCGS Griffin, based in Prescott, ON, Canada on the St. Lawrence River, but doesn't have Canada-specific markings so that it will be useful in other contexts.
